<p>Use status indicators for any entity with states that may impact the customer's experience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indicators use a solid color to represent status, such as "error, warning, active, or disabled".</li>
  <li>Use .rs-status for the pill-style component. It is most often the first item on an entity's <a href="#details">details</a> page.</li>
  <li>The <a href="#colored-text">colored text</a> style (without .rs-status) is often used in a table to explain a process.</li>
  <li>Improve the API status formatting as necessary (e.g., change API strings from ALL CAPS to Title Case).</li>
</ul>
