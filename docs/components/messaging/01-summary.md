<p>Use messaging when the user should be made aware of important events, statuses, failures, dependencies, or required action.  Messages come in two primary forms: <a href="">Banner Messages</a> and <a href="">Embedded Messages</a>.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Messages come in 4 color styles.  Use them wisely based on the status, or severity of the message that is being communicated.</li>
  <li>Only message the user about really important things.  Using banners too often for success messaging, marketing, and other constants can lead to banner blindness, causing users to miss the truly important info.</li>
  <li>Users don't read, they scan.  Write your message out in plain, easy to understand language, then cut the word count in half.  After that try cutting the word count in half again, because that's about as much as most users will scan.</li>
  <li>Don't expose error codes to your users.  Just don't.</li>
  <li>If the message is about a certain undesireable state, make sure to provide the user with a clear call to action to resolve the issue.</li>
</ul>
